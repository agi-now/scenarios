.Agent’s input interface is a queue of text messages coming from a user.
Agent’s output interface is a console (using print function)
The agent receives messages from a user and can reply back by printing things to a console.
User’s messages are asynchronous. 
Only one on one conversations.

Virtual Circuits
Real world has circuit elements. Elements have input and output pins. Output pins can be connected with input pins. Pins contain integer values. Every “clock cycle” input pins take the value of the output pins and output pins are being updated by the elements.
Input pin = IP, Output pin = OP

World contains elements like:

Display - displays integer value.
Has one IP to take the value to be displayed.
Button - can influence other object when pressed.
Has one OP that will send the value of 1 when the button is pressed.
Will be triggered even if unpressed before the clock cycle.
Timer - sends a pulse signal every N seconds.
Signal can trigger buttons and other objects.
Microchip - runs mathematical operations.
Has arbitrary number of input and output pins.

The agent has an API to interact with the real world:
press_button("button1")
get_pin_value("display", "pin0")
list_pins("display")
