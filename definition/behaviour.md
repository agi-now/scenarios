Let's compact all my symbolic theory of elements, components, relationships, behaviours, attribute, patterns etc. Into just "UST" (Universal symbolic theory)

Ability
- To perceive
    - To define env functions (Element solidification) of UST instances
    - To see>
        - To read text
    - To hear
    - To be able to identify any UST instance
- To make decision
    - Association cause -> effect
    - To reason using logic
    - To do inner simulations
        - To plan
        - To do mental logic processes like comparison
- To act
    - To define act functions (Act solidification)
    - To follow instructions/algorithms/protocols

- To have full mental cycles
    - To communicate
        - To route ideas (IN)
        - To communicate ideas (OUT)
            - To ask questions (IN)
            - To answer questions (OUT)
        - To break text into logic relatable bits (This is what makes us truly understand ideas)
            This ability is crucial, with this you also gain the ability:
            - To understand and answer any question
    - To learn
        - To learn autonomusly (Trial and error, experiment)
            - To infere knowledge

- To understand and remember
    - To understand time
        - Sequenciation
        - Timing of actions
        - Time linked events
    - To understand space
    - To store semantinc memories
    - To store episodic memories

    - To manage temporal and long term memory

    - To understand any system (LRD)

    - To be able to store, abstract and categorize any UST instance
